# Assets Directory

This directory contains app assets like icons and splash screens.

For a production app, you would need:
- icon.png (1024x1024)
- splash.png (2048x2732)  
- adaptive-icon.png (1024x1024)
- favicon.png (48x48)

For now, you can use placeholder images or generate them using:
- https://www.appicon.co/
- https://www.figma.com/
- https://expo.github.io/vector-icons/

The app icon should represent the मूल्यमापन (Assessment) theme with educational elements.
